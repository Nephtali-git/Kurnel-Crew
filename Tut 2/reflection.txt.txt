Challenges:  
I found this assignment initially overwhelming because I lacked familiarity with compiling software from source. Many commands (like `make` or `git clone`) were new to me, and I couldn’t rely on my usual YouTube tutorials for step-by-step help.  

How I Solved Problems:  
- Used AI tools (like ChatGPT) to explain commands when stuck (e.g., "What does `sudo make install` do?").  
- Learned why each step mattered (e.g., `apt install` downloads dependencies, `make` compiles code).  
- Fixed errors by asking AI to translate technical messages (like "dangling reference" warnings).  

Key Takeaways:  
- Compiling from source is powerful but requires patience.  
- Breaking tasks into small steps (install → compile → run) made it manageable.  
- AI helped bridge gaps in my knowledge, but I now understand the a bit process better.  

Difficulty Rating:  
- Without help: 8/10 (felt lost at times).  
- With AI guidance: 3.5/10 (could troubleshoot confidently). I didn't even know I had to press q to quit after running btop...lmao:-)

Something I would recommend you guys to do:
Give us more activities on these kind of basic concepts so we can master them because if you only do it once you can forget it easily
